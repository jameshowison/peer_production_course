This is the repository for I320D: Open Source Software Development.

The course is a fork of a masters course called, "Peer Production".  You can see the [full syllabus for Peer Production](https://jameshowison.github.io/peer_production_course/pp_syllabus.html) to get an overview.

The undergraduate version, currently being developed, will be similar in many ways:

1. The emphasis on learning git and github collaboration
2. The overall sociotechnical approach where technical skills are matched with readings about underlying concepts (e.g., as we learn git collaboration we will read about collaboration theory from organization science, as we read open source licenses we will read about copyright law and cases).

And differ in a few ways:

1. Projects will not be ethnographic participation, they will be data analysis of records left by open source projects.  These might be language analyses or correlations/regressions using summaries of activity in github repositories.
2. The scope will be tighter on open source, rather than wikipedia or creative commons.
3. Students will not be required to locate and describe adaptations of peer production.
4. We will learn about packaging of software (e.g., pip and CRAN).
5. Added material on security implications and management of open source as "procurement risk".

So as the course is being developed, reference the peer production syllabus and repository, but keep the points above in mind.

The course will be useful for those that want to work in data science roles, but also help understand how open source software works and how it has changed the world of software and beyond.
