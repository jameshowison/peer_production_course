                              How Taipei Ethereum Meetup Adapts Peer Production Practice           Chun-Wei Wang

   With the development and widespreadness of open-source practice, more and more online communities applied an open-source structure with different practices to attract new possible members, better manage the community, and share the contribution of its members with protection. One of the most popular practices is Peer production, a significant innovation that has merged from Internet-mediated social practice. (Benkler, 2016) As many communities applied peer production practice and conducted desirable achievement, this kind of open-source practice became more well-known and appealed more online communities to adapt to this practice. In this article, we will discuss the adaptation of this practice in a specific online blockchain community, Taipei Ethereum Meetup, and see what they applied and not applied the innovation into their community. In addition, we'll look into the difficulties for them while adapting peer production and discuss how to address these problems and help this community successfully adapting this practice to bring better management and operation.

1. What is peer production?

    So far, there's no aligned definition of peer production. However, there is one definition that is accepted by most people now is from Benkler, Peer Production and Cooperation (2016). According to Benkler, "the organization that applied peer production should include three characteristics: (1) Decentralization of conception and execution of problems and solutions. (2) Diverse motivations, including a range of non-monetary motivations, are central. (3) Organization (Governance and management) is separated from property and contract." (Benkler, 2016) Base on this definition, we will look into the Taipei Ethereum Meetup and identify how they adapted the peer production practice and discuss the obstacles they faced and how to address these problems.

2. Taipei Ethereum Meetup (TEM)

    Taipei Ethereum Meetup (TEM) is a community created by a group of technophiles in blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and smart contracts in order to have academic discussion and exchange. Back in 2016, when the term blockchain hasn't even introduced into Taiwan, a group of technology enthusiasts met in a small academic conference called Blockchain's Smart Contract Conference, which most of them didn't really understand what the topic meant. However, some of them were still inspired by the conference and decided to initiate a study group to learn more about blockchain. This was the predecessor of the Taipei Ethereum Meetup. 

    With the rapid blooming of Cryptocurrency, more and more people were interested in the field of blockchain. Seeing the growth of needs in learning about blockchain, members in TEM decided to take a further step to introduce related knowledge to people in Taiwan. Starting from inviting experts in their own network to share studies and current development in the global blockchain field, TEM is now one of the largest and well-known developer's communities of blockchain and Cryptocurrency in Asia. 

    Although TEM was once blooming with Cryptocurrency, it now cools down with the declining of Cryptocurrency. After the fever of cryptocurrency mining decayed, TEM not only fails to keep growing steady but also faces the problem of losing current active members. However, the declining also brings a chance for TEM to build a more technical and in-depth community.

     Other than having academic exchanges, TEM also dedicates in advocating blockchain knowledge and trends in Taiwan. By working in an open-source way, TEM creates the blockchain wiki, holds onsite sharing, maintains a blog on Medium, and provides job information all around the world. To help the students, developers, and technophiles in Taiwan to keep up with the global trends of blockchain and expand their knowledge, TEM holds one to two large academic conferences every year. In these large academic conferences, TEM would invite famous scholars around the world to share their latest studies and research, which makes these conferences one of the biggest events in Asia blockchain communities.

    To better understand the connection between Taipei Ethereum Meetup and peer production, we interviewed one of the initial members to learn further about how they manage and operate this community to make contributions and achieve their goal.

3. The adaptation of peer production in Taipei Ethereum Meetup

    The Taipei Ethereum Meetup operates in some ways that are included in peer production. First of all, there's no exact decision team in TEM, according to the initial member. The whole community reviewed all the events, initiatives, and projects. Once a member shares their initiatives in the community, and no one else holds strong opinions against it, they're allowed to recruit contributors in the community and start to put it into practice under the name of TEM. This is one of the best examples of decentralized concepts and executions, which is also one of the main characteristics of peer production.

    Furthermore, TEM values information transparency very much, which is also seen in most peer production communities. That is, not only operating as an open-source community that allows everyone to use all their data and results, TEM also gives everyone access to see the community operation information such as the application of funds. This builds trust for all the contributors in the community. By knowing how much funds they receive, where the funds come from, and where they spend those funds, the contributors can make sure that the community is stick to the goal and doing things that they expected to see from this community. 

    Another thing to discuss here is how TEM advocates open-source ways by seriously evaluate their sponsors. Since most of the current Cryptocurrency was built on Ethereum, which is "free and open-source that can be forked and replicated into other systems that remain compatible" (Dannen, 2017), TEM values and advocates organization that has an open-source spirit. As a result, whenever there is an organization that wants to sponsor their events, they will do some research about that organization to see if it equipped any open-source spirits. In fact, the initial member emphasized how TEM values the open-source: "There were two potential sponsors that were willing to provide considerable funding, which might not only fills our gap for the big conference this year but also allows us to not worry about inviting several speakers in the future sharing. However, we decided to turn down their offers since we found out that these two organizations are just normal companies with no involvement in any open-source issues." Based on the fact that the initial member shared, we can see how serious TEM is toward the open-source spirits. 
    
    Finally, contributors in TEM share diverse motivations and none of them is related to non-monetary. As mentioned before, this community is created by a group of technology enthusiasts; most of them just found that this technology is interesting. With the growth of the community, some joined not only to learn more about blockchain and Cryptocurrency but also to find ways to introduce the technology to more and more people, especially those who have no idea about blockchain at all. Also, reputations of this community and the achievement of sharing their own knowledge are motivations that the contributors may hold. However, some participants may have the intention to earn money through investing Cryptocurrency when they join this community. These participants may not be an actual contributor to this community. They just came in to learn whatever they were looking for and then left. As a result, these participants were never considered as members of this community. According to the initial member, there was a boosting growth of TEM two years ago because of the prevailing mining for Bitcoin. However, after the trends declined, TEM is now back to the previous situation as a place for knowledge and learning.

4. The problem for Taipei Ethereum Meetup while adapting peer production

    While it seems that the Taipei Ethereum Meetup applied most of the elements of peer production well, there is on crucial issues that kinds of keeping them out from fully adapting peer production. Unlike most peer production communities that can still identify their governance or management teams, TEM has no governance or management team at all. 

    As mentioned before, TEM was originally a small study group for some technophiles then turned into a community because of the growth. This development brings a serious issue about this community; that is, they don't really have a core target or a shared vision. "Although in a period, we saw that advocating the blockchain technology, sharing it to more people in Taiwan is our vision, we found out that we were not really following this idea." said the initial member. The reason for this issue is that most of the members in TEM did share the same idea to introduce the blockchain technology to more people; however, this goal valued differently to different members. Some saw this goal as the most important value for them to participate in TEM; some thought that it was good to have the goal, but the most important thing to them is learning more and deeper about this technology for their own needs. 
    
    This controversy leads to the diverse of the small sharings they hold. Members who hope to introduce and attract more people to this field will focus on introducing understandable issues to the general audience when planning for a sharing event while those who seek more knowledge and studies will focus on inviting experts to talk about abstruse new studies and research. As the resource of TEM is limited, they have to negotiate a lot to decide which event to hold, and the lack of governance and management team make it even harder to achieve agreements. 

    Another example that the initial member shared about how this controversy influenced their operation is about the recent large conference. TEM is having one of its largest events this year at the end of October. However, they haven't decided to hold this conference until the end of August. The late decision was due to some disagreement in the community and made it more challenging to have this conference happen. Even though the schedule is tight, they still put every effort to make this conference better. However, another controversy appeared while planning how to promote and record this event. For people who would like to attract more new people into this field, they wanted to find professional writing workers such as journalists or technology reporters to translate those difficult topics and contents into comprehensive reports for the general audience. On the other hand, the learning-focus members argued that this was unnecessary costs and also delayed their schedule of planning this conference. Since there are not exact governance or leadership team, this debate lasted for weeks and delayed all the other tasks on the plan.

    As a result, one of the critical issues for TEM is to define a general governance model. People might reduce their contribution because of the lack of a suitable governance model. Also, a governance model can also help the community to clearly define the boundaries and keep the contributors in the same direction. (Gardler & Hanganu, 2013) As a result, having a governance model may help TEM operating more successfully and smoothly in the short-term and also benefits TEM to keep growing and stay on the right track in a long-term way. However, to become a more robust community and achieve a higher destination, TEM still needs to decide what their core values and visions are. For any organization, the lack of an aligned destination or visionary goal makes the operation more challenging and restricts the potential contribution that it can bring to society.  
    
5. Conclusion

    To sum up, with the growth of peer production communities, more discussion and research on this practice are coming up. According to Benkler's definition of peer production, Taipei Ethereum Meetup is very close to being a peer production community and may benefit from further adapting to this practice. By constructing an appropriate governance model and identifying the organizational target, TEM will be able to adapt the peer production practice better, reduce the obstacles they are struggling with currently, and lead the community to further growth to bring more contribution to the blockchain field and society.
