## Steam Workshop
Steam Workshop is affiliated  to Steam, a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation. It is a central hub of player-created content and tools to publish, organize, and download that content into your games.

## Dota 2 AI scripting

* Dota 2 is a multi-player Online Battle Area game. Apart from playing with human players, we can also play with bots.
* The default bot is weak so Valve opened the AI scripting on the Workshop so that we can program our custom AI script.

## My project

My project is called Ranked Matchmaking AI. The main developer hopes this script can simulate the experience of playing with human players.
