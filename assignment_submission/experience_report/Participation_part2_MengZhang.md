## Brief recall of the project
As I mentioned in the first part, the community I choose to participate in is the Steam Workshop. In specific, I chose to contribute to a bot script of Dota 2. This script, Ranked Matchmaking AI, consists of hundreds of files written in Lua, a programming language which is widely used in the field of video game logic programming. This project is open source and can be found on GitHub. The main developer will publish the latest version of Steam Workshop.

## My experience of participation
My participation started on March 20th. The first thing I did was to fork the GitHub repository of this project and cloned it on my local laptop. Since I never used Lua before, I took some time to have a quick study of its grammar. Thankfully, Lua is easy to understand, and I have knowledge of other programming languages, and I can also learn from the comments of this project made by the main developer. As a result, two days later I had started modifying parts of the code.  
I started by doing some easy job. Currently, although the project is the No.1 Popular script on Steam with more than 1 million subscribers, it still has tons of bugs and many detections. So I modified some values of some files so that the AI will act in a more reasonable way. On March 23rd, I sent the first pull request and it was approved on the same day.
In the following weeks, I kept working on it. I gradually become capable of modifying some logic functions and even add some new features. I may still contribute to this project even when this course ends.

## How my works were reviewed
All my commits will be reviewed by the main developer of this project via GitHub. He will consider whether my contribution is useful, as well as whether there're any bugs that I will produce. Actually, not every one of my commits is approved. For my third commit, the author refused to merge it because "many changes are unnecessary and the understanding of some functions are wrong". I had to revise and improve my codes until he finally approved it.
## What I have accomplished
In the past 30 days, I am the main contributor to maintain and update this script. Until now, I have made 8 commits with adding/deleting/modifying 8000 lines of codes. I helped published several new versions from 1.4e to 1.5c. The number of subscribers rose from 1050000 to 1150000. I even created a beta script for this project for testing and attracted 7000 subscribers to try it. Here I heard from them about feedbacks of my work and made further improvements.
## The difference between my experience and my expectation
My experience is far beyond my expectation. I thought it would be hard to code it, while in fact, it's easy to make contributions because there're so many aspects that can be optimized. However, there're also many barriers for me, like I didn't have enough communication with the main developer since he is always super busy. Also, many users of our script speak Spanish or Russian, which I cannot understand. So I am unable to read their feedbacks. This task is also time-consuming so I may give up participating it in the future.
