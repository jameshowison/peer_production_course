# Community Identification

-** Community introduction **
The community I`m going to study is the API samples of The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). The DPLA aggregates metadata from over 1,800 libraries, archives, and museums and it is a US project aimed at providing public access to digital holdings in order to create a large-scale public digital library. DPLA also has something for every developer. It interacts with the software development community in numerous important ways. From a public API and bulk download that grant access to all of DPLA’s records under a permissive license. 

It has its own APIs, tools and technical documents for developers developing their own programs, such as analyzing data source in the library, and cloud data processing. To help with your development( Of course you should apply for the key to DPLA API) , a large set of samples are offered in their Github. The samples are in different types, like usage of DPyLA(which is doing data analysis with Python), and usage of Json-LD(which is processing Linked Data in Json format).

-** How it works **
The code samples lies under where the tools or APIs occur, so you can read the code after studying concepts of tools or APIs. So the samples can help learners have better understanding towards the existing tools. When you try to make some changes to the existing samples, you should firstly read the codes of other person`s to make sure if they have the same idea with you. Everyone can add something in samples to make an improvement. 

-** The reason why it is Peer Production **
Firstly the samples are open source, it is quite obvious as the codes are in Github and everyone of us can fork or clone them. Secondly, write code and upload them to make out-of-copyright improvement online, so the initial developer and people who are learning it have more concepts to consider. Thirdly, the motivations developers have are not making money, they just share their ideas and wait for the followers having better understanding towards those APIs after reading the code. According to these reasons, I think it is Peer Production.

-** Expectation**
What I`m going to do is, firstly studying the APIs and tools in DPLA developing pool, and then contributing one sample or two for different types, maybe one for “DPyLA” and one for “JSON-LD”. And I will share the codes on Github then wait for someone leaving some comments. Or I can also adjust another guy`s code and make it more understandable for new learners, then update the changes on Github. And all of these manipulation needs the permission of administers.
