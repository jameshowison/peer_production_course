    "text": "Welcome to the materials for a course on open source software development, taught at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. The course is taught by James Howison, with contributions from a set of wonderful TAs, and\nThe course was developed as an undergraduate version of a course on Peer Production: Open Source, Wikipedia, and Beyond.\nI call this a “socio-technical course” because I interleave social theory about open source (such as theories of motivation, approaches to governance, sources of lack of diversity) in among the technical skills needed to participate in open source projects (git and github commands, markdown, unit testing, packaging). This interleaving is inspired equally by Karl Fogel’s approach in Producing Open Source Software, and the intellectual traditions of Sociotechnical Systems, Sociomateriality, and the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems (CSST).\nIn these materials I present these in two separate sequences: “insights” and “skills”. When I teach, though, I interleave them in what I hope are synergistic ways. For example, when teaching about coordination theory, the week includes the git and github approaches to managing dependencies (such as identifying and resolving conflicts, as well as branching). I pair literature on knowledge sharing up with skills to do it, such as understanding Markdown and referring to Issues/Commits. You can see this interleaving in the most recent syllabus at Section 2.1.\nThe course begins with a two-part physical in-class exercise: students fold paper planes, and share improvements. The first exercise addresses how patents and copyright affect sharing, building on each others work, and the division of claims. The second takes a more technical tack, and addresses management of versions and conflicts. These exercises give a physical analog for the topics in the course, giving a grounding for discussing intellectual concepts and git commands."

    "text": "3 Objectives and Assignments\nThis course explores “open source software development” which is a name for the open collaborations that produce open source software. Open source software is a thing that is built by people, an artifact. But the way that it is developed, the way that people work together to build it is of great interest. “The open source way” is of practical interest for everyone building software, because open source development has lead the creation of ways of working used throughout software work. For social and organizational scholars, “the open source way” is of inte3rest in advancing our theories of how people can work together and how technology matters.\nThe “open source way” is also known as “peer production” and that way of working extends beyond open source, to places like Wikipedia. Perhaps not coincidentally the Wikipedia page on Peer Production is quite useful:\nAs we learn about open source and peer production we’ll learn to distinguish it from different kinds of online collaborations, such as crowdsourcing, citizen science, question and answer sites, and mere sharing of code. Near synonyms for the way of working taught in this course are: “The open source way”, “Open collaboration”, “Open mass production”.\nThis is a course is about a sociotechnical phenomenon and it takes a sociotechnical approach. In practice this means that we’ll be learning both conceptual insight and practical skills. The course weaves together learning how to use key technologies of collaboration (e.g., git, github, travisCI, markdown) at the same time that we learn social and organizational theory about peer production (e.g., the role of copyright licenses, motivations of participants, governance models, coordination theory, models of collaboration risk, cultures of collaboration).\nThere are no prereqs for this course. While we will be discussing software development students will not be required to program. We will use the command line as we learn to use git and github everything will be covered in class. I try to build a set of analogies for git and github, going beyond teaching the commands to give ways to think about git.\nStudents will need access to a computer for classes, any version of Windows, Mac, or Linux will do. Students facing difficulties with their IT should contact the iSchool help desk (via help@ischool.utexas.edu) who can refer on to other resources as available."

Students should email the professor prior to class if they cannot make it. Material throughout the course builds on earlier material (both technical and conceptual). If you cannot make class you should refer to the online materials first and then consult with your classmates. Office hours are not for personal replays of teaching, nor can they compensate for not participating in discussion.\nHints on participation:\n\nUseful participation can come from asking questions if you don’t understand the point someone is making. If you have questions, very likely others do to.\nYou can also summarize discussion which helps everyone by giving them something to test their understanding of the discussion.\nYou can challenge or disagree with people, sometimes that can be introducing a counter-example or questioning whether evidence really means what the speaker originally thought.\nI really welcome examples from your own experience. For example if there is an organization, movement, or line of thought (modern/traditional) in your culture that relates to open source development, I would love that to be part of the discussion.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Technical Challenges\nThe course will have assignments based on the technical topics we are learning, including use of the DataCamp course (see below).\n\n\n3.2.3 Open Source comparison paper\nFor this assignment students will write a 1,000 word scholarly essay describing and analyzing efforts to adapt the “open source way” outside of software development. Students will be given a list of five projects they need to research and analyze to compare to “the open source way”. Examples could include open hardware, open governance, open culture. The paper should draw on the conceptual literature to compare and contrast the challenge faced by these adaptation efforts to what we’ve learned about “the open source way”. The paper will also describe the collaboration infrastructure used and compare it to the technologies we have learned in class).\nThe paper will be authored in Plain Text or Markdown and submitted via a pull request to the class github. Include your name in the filename and at the top of the document, and include a note at the top of the file telling me which formal citation approach you are using (e.g., APA, MLA, etc). Students are cautioned that as a scholarly paper proper citation and use of sources is required otherwise students will face academic misconduct proceedings. See “Academic Integrity” presentation if at all unsure.\n\n\n3.2.4 Open Source Trace Data analysis Project\nStudents will be introduced to datasets of archives of activity in open source projects and develop their own analysis. For example, students might want to highlight those participants that are most active over time in a project, show whether leadership has changed within projects, or analyze license usage over time.\nThere are three graded components, each to be submitted via a pull request. All components should reference the insight readings that we do throughout the course.\n\nIdentifying and describing a project. ~500 words. Authored in plain text or markdown (ensure file is encoded with Unicode UTF-8 encoding and Unix/LF-only line endings). This paper should clearly identify the intended analysis and argue for its relevance, including using literature to identify expectations. Include your name in the filename and at the top of the document, and include a note at the top of the file telling me which formal citation approach you are using (e.g., APA, MLA, etc).\nImplementing the analysis and report. ~500-1000 words, authored in RMarkdown, using the citation features. Students should describe the dataset, their analysis (possibly including graphs), and their interpretation. Students should compare their experience with their expectations described in the first paper and use at least two references from our conceptual literature to justify their inquiry. Create a folder in assignment_submission/trace_data_project/your_name and all files in that folder. Submit via a pull request from a branch created just for this submission (i.e., not master), and post that URL to the Canvas assignment, ensure this is a separate PR from your slide submission (below).\nCreating and giving a presentation on their participation. Presentations are limited to 5 minutes, this should be approx 4-6 slides long and be authored using Markdown that produces slides. Presentations will occur in our final class meeting. Submit via a pull request from a branch created just for this submission (ie not master), and post that URL to the Canvas assignment."

    "text": "6.2 To avoid “proprietary lock in”\nThe popularity of open source can be understand as a kind of software escrow. Producers of tools want their users to rely on the tool, but if the code is hidden then a user is taking on a significant risk. That is is that the software stops getting updated because the company disappears. This means that maintenance stops, which means that the code suffers “bit rot” or “code collapse”.\n“Code collapse” occurs when software is not maintained. Not only do new features not appear, but security holes can be discovered which cannot be fixed. More subtly the code gets out of sync with its ecosystem, so that the way it talks to other software might stop working as other software is updated. If something changes in the software requirements (e.g., a change in the tax code) then the software cannot be updated.\nSo the buyer of proprietary software want an assurance that the software will continue to be updated, but no firm can assure its customers that it will be around for ever. To solve this purchasers used an approach called “Software Escrow”. Escrow means using a 3rd party (not the firm buying the software and not the firm building the software) to keep a copy of the software delivered. That escrow agent keeps that code secret unless specific events occurs, such as the software producer going out of business or discontinuing the product. In those cases the firm buying the code gets the source (and a license to use it). Escrow is a sort of insurance policy to help make relying on other people less risky.\nOpen source shares some of these characteristics. When building on someone else’s code, knowing it is open source means that the user can be sure they can taken over maintenance, even if the original developers stop working on the project."

    "text": "6.3 Shared maintenance of infrastructure\nWhen organizations compete with each other they want you to purchase their product, and not the product of their competitor. To purchase “Extra” brand chewing gum, and not “Trident” brand.\nYet much of the effort that goes into producing a product is spent on things that are not directly related to the product they are selling. Think of things like the supply of office furniture, the repainting of lines in the parking lot. These sort of efforts are known as “infrastructure”.\nIn many cases infrastructure is purchased from other companies, known as “contracting” or “out-sourcing”. The general logic is that companies that specialize in office furniture will do a better and cheaper job than if the chewing gum company was to make (or even buy) its own furniture. For example, Economics of scale mean that the outsourced furniture company can get bulk purchase discounts and pass them on to customers. They can also have full time people focused on monitoring safety issues with furniture and be responsible for fixing or replacing chairs that might injure people, saving the chewing gum company from lawsuits for dangerous chairs.\nMany users of open source are using open source software in the same way. For example IBM had a product called “WebSphere” which they sold to firms to run their “intranet” (internal corporate network publishing information or managing business processes). IBM originally wrote and maintained their own web server (as well as the application software that ran on top of it). Eventually, though, they changed to using the open source web server called Apache httpd. They argued that this saved them a lot of time maintaining their own infrastructure internally.\nIBM even started contributing changes that it needed or were helpful to their product back to httpd. They could have kept those changes secret, but then they would just have more infrastructure to maintain. Instead, they reasoned, they would contribute those changes back to httpd, effectively giving that work to their competitors (and everyone), but in return they received a lot more eyeballs on that code, ensuring that it was better tested and kept in sync.\nThey shared the cost of maintenance on the infrastructure to concentrate effort on their “secret sauce” of the WebSphere application layer, which was the thing that customers were really buying from them."

You read about farmers who purchase John Deere farm equipment. Many want to be able to work on their equipment on their own, right on the farm. This is both because they are at a great distance from dealers, the equipment is expensive to transport, and they have paid a lot for the equipment and object to paying more to keep it working.\nIn many ways this is the same situation that Richard Stallman (found of the Free Software Foundation) faced when dealing with the printer in his office. This is one of the foundational stories of the free software movement.\nHave you faced issues in trying to repair something? What prevented you?\nDiscussion: what is needed to repair a blender? A car? A list sorting algorithm? A web-page?\nWhat role does source code play? What else is needed?\n\n\n3.3.2 To avoid “proprietary lock in”\nThe popularity of open source can be understand as a kind of software escrow. Producers of tools want their users to rely on the tool, but if the code is hidden then a user is taking on a significant risk. That is is that the software stops getting updated because the company disappears. This means that maintenance stops, which means that the code suffers “bit rot” or “code collapse”.\n“Code collapse” occurs when software is not maintained.
